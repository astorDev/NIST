Slightly darker than the `None` theme.

## Theme 3: Moon

To be honest, that's the theme I enjoy the least.

The Blackest theme.

## Theme 8: Kepler

## Theme 9: Mars

The most interesting theme out of all, but I'm afraid it will saturate quickly, so I'll probably refrain from it.

## Theme 10: Deep Space

## My Choice

I will go with the `Deep Space` theme. The theme looks interesting, while still not being too extravagant, which make it suitable for something you would use often.
