# Nginx and Docker: Getting Started

Nginx and Docker are probably two dominant components of backend infrastructure nowdays. Still, there's not much information on how to make them play together.

The setup we've end up with should be enough to serve as a fundament for any infrastructure you may want to build. There's also a [source code](https://github.com/astorDev/nist/tree/main/proxy/nginx/playground) for you to play around with. And by the way... claps are appreciated! üëè
