Although .NET web templates give a solid foundation for your apps, there are still quite a few tasks the default template just don't solve. So during the years I came up with my own template, that addresses all the thing I miss in the default template. This article will walk you though the thing I've added to help

## There's a Gift in the End!

The article walk you through the things I added to the project template. This should give you a sense of what you may want to add to your own project. 

If you don't want to do it from scratch my go-to template is available [here on github](https://github.com/astorDev/nist/tree/main/templates/dotnet). 

Give the template a try! And also... claps are appreciated ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ
